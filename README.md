Low-fidelity model of the complex international rail bridge and automobile bridge between Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario (Canada) and Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan (U.S.), suitable for use in flight simulators (where it will rarely be viewed close-up).  While it's not intended for driving simulators, there is a continuous roadway.
